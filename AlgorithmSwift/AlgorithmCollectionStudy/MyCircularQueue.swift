//622. Design Circular Queue
//Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".
//
//One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.
//
//Your implementation should support following operations:
//
//MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
//Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
//Rear: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
//enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
//deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
//isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
//isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
